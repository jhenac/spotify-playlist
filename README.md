# spotify-playlist
Created a playlist of tracks scraped from Billboard 100.

Using beautiful soup, a list of songs and corresponding artists from an inputted date was scraped from Billboard 100 site.

Using spotipy and Spotify API, a playlist was created and the scraped songs were added into the playlist.

I finished this project on November 8, 2022, the day of commemmoration of Typhoon Yolanda that devastated Leyte Province, Philippines. 
So I picked November 8, 2013, the day of the devastation, as the date for the web scraping, to find out the top tracks played at the time.
